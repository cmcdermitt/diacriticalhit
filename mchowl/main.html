        Hello! This website was created to celebrate the paranormal sitcom <em>McHowl's Navy</em>, which aired on CBS from 1968-1971. It was never the #1 hit, but it was always popular until it was cancelled following the murder of its producer, Esteban Lupetto, and it's still beloved by us!. During the first two seasons, it was on at 7:30 PM on Fridays, but during the third season it was on at 6 PM on Tuesdays.
